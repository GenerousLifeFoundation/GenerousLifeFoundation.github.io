	Founded in the year 2016, <strong>Generous Life Foundation</strong> is a foundation which primarily seeks to help the poor and less privileged in society. The foundation was established so that through it, the poor and the less privileged could also experience the love of God through the generosity shown by the foundation towards them.
	</p><br>

	<h3 class="mh3">HOW IT ALL BEGAN</h3>
	<p>Generous Life Foundation was founded by <strong>Mr. Gyandoh  Nkwafi</strong> with the aid of some few friends in the year <strong>2016</strong>.The foundation originally started with the name, <strong>Save A Life Foundation</strong>. However, this name had to change because it was found out that an existing foundation had already registered using the name, Save A Life Foundation. So the name of the foundation was later changed to <strong>Trinity Foundation</strong> which represented the three-in-one God. Unfortunately that name also had to be changed because once again another foundation had registered using that name. So it was this latter change that landed us with the name, <strong>Generous Life Foundation</strong>. The name Generous Life Foundation speaks concerning the generosity of its members towards the poor and less privileged thus making it an excellent choice when it comes to having a name for the foundation. As a matter of fact <strong>Galatians 5:22</strong> talks about <strong>“generosity”</strong> being a fruit of the Spirit and the foundation helps its members bear this fruit by being generous to the poor and less privileged.</p><br>

	<h3 class="mh3">DONATIONS AND MEETINGS</h3>
	<p>The first meeting held by the foundation when it was first established took place on the land of <strong>Pope John Senior High School</strong> on the <strong>29th of March, 2016</strong>. With the primary aim of helping the poor and less privileged, the foundation was able to organize its <strong>first donation</strong> on the <strong>26th of December, 2016</strong>. The donation, led by Mr. Nkwafi Gyandoh Emmanuel, took place at <strong>My Good Shepherd Orphanage</strong> located in Akwatia. A number of food items were bought and distributed to this orphanage home to put smiles on their faces and to show them the love of God. Since that time till now, the foundation has organized several donations to help better the lives of others. Places the foundation has visited include <strong>Jehovah Rapha in Suhum, SOS in Asiakwa etc...</strong> It is with this that the foundation calls on all people out there to support us so that together we can put smiles on the faces of the orphans and less privileged.</p><br>
